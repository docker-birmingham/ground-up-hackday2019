## Docker Hackday 2019

### Overview

Welcome to the hackday project.  The aim it to containerise two very simple applications which interact with a database,
using docker-compose to orchestrate the components and run some basic tests.

The problems that you will need to solve here using the standard Docker tooling are ones which you'll most likely 
encounter in a real-world environment where you have a distributed polyglot application stack.

### Getting started

You'll need Docker and Docker compose installed on your machine / VM / whatever.  Instructions for this can be found 
on the Docker website for your specific host setup.
